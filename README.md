# Project Name

This project was about creating a digital version of the classic board game Guess Who. The main objectives was to practice creating objects and arrays and connecting to the DOM. 

## The problem

At first I had to refresh my memory on how this game works in order to get an idea on how to build it. So the game is basically about guessing on different traits a person might have, such as hair color, eye color and accessories and then making a guess on who it might be. At first I found the code to be much new code to process so I went through it, step by step, using the Technigo instructions. This was quite helpful but also looking for previously asked questions regarding the project on Stack Overflow and engaging in conversations with team members on Slack. 

If I had more time I would try to do the project without the instructions and I would most definitely work on getting my own characters in the game, with different personalities and traits :) For this project I mainly focused on understanding the JavaScript, how the functions work and getting an understanding of both an oject and how an array works. I have struggled with understanding how conditionals work and that is something I want to focus more on.
